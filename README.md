## Featured Projects
### Zillow Housing Affordability
**Regression modeling & urban economics** 

Tools: *R, data.table, ggplot2, stargazer*
- Built multivariate linear regression models to study how **new construction impacts housing affordability** across U.S. metros (2020–2024).  
- Aggregated Zillow metro-level data into cross-sectional datasets; included predictors for new construction, monthly payments, and market heat.  
- Conducted exploratory and confirmatory analyses with robust standard errors and heteroskedasticity tests.

### Air Quality & Vehicle Registration in Europe
**Machine learning & environmental analytics**  

Tools: *Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib*
- Predicted **PM2.5 pollution levels** using electric vehicle adoption, fuel data, and population metrics across Europe.

### Doctor Gender Bias Experiment
**Causal inference & behavioral experimentation**  

 Tools: *R, causal inference experiment, web dev (React), usability design and testing*
