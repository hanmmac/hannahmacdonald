# Hi, I'm Hannah MacDonald 

I am in my final semester of the Master of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley, with a background in HCM consulting and hands-on experience in data conversion, modeling, and product-focused analytics. 
- Experienced in delivering client-ready solutions and leading cross-functional projects, with a strong interest in building data-driven products that combine technical rigor with design and usability.
- Enjoy working at the intersection of **data, design, and decision-making** — from user insight to product strategy.

## Featured Projects
### 🏠 Zillow Housing Affordability
**Regression modeling & urban economics**  
- Built multivariate linear regression models to study how **new construction impacts housing affordability** across U.S. metros (2020–2024).  
- Aggregated Zillow metro-level data into cross-sectional datasets; included predictors for new construction, monthly payments, and market heat.  
- Conducted exploratory and confirmatory analyses with robust standard errors and heteroskedasticity tests.  
📊 *R, data.table, ggplot2, stargazer*

### 🌍 Air Quality & EV Adoption in Europe
**Machine learning & environmental analytics**  
- Predicted **PM2.5 pollution levels** using electric vehicle adoption, fuel data, and population metrics across Europe.  
- Engineered features, normalized across country samples, and trained models with XGBoost and PCA.  
- Evaluated feature importance and fairness between over- and under-represented regions.  
🤖 *Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib*

### 🧠 Doctor Gender Bias Experiment
**Causal inference & behavioral experimentation**  
- Designed and analyzed a **randomized survey experiment testing gender bias** in doctor selection using a mock booking website.  
- Randomly assigned doctor gender while holding qualifications constant; measured differences in participant choices.  
- Estimated treatment effects using regression and randomization inference.  
📈 *Python, R, causal inference methods, survey design*

### 💸 Finance Network Graph (Neo4j)
**Knowledge graph & data relationships**  
- Built a **Neo4j graph database** mapping relationships between financial entities, sectors, and market signals.  
- Designed schema to visualize flows between investors, companies, and funding events. 
- Used Cypher queries to explore connected components and centrality.  
🕸️ *Neo4j, Cypher, network analysis*

### ✈️ Global Tourism Insights Dashboard
**Data visualization & web design**  
- Created an **interactive tourism insights web app** visualizing visitor trends, destinations, and economic indicators.  
- Designed user flows and dashboards with usability testing and iterative feedback.  
- Built in Flask and Altair, deployed with Vercel for lightweight access.  
🌐 *Python (Flask), Altair, HTML/CSS, usability testing*
